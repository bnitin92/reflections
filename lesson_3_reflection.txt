When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we would like to share our work/code with others than we can use remote 
    repository to update our work in github. Another advantage will be that we 
    will have a copy of aur repository and even if we lose it locally we can fetch 
    it any time from GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is because the changes made on github might be the changes made by some 
    other contributor or by yourself and the only time you would like to pull is
    when you want to make changes on the updated version of your github code.
