When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we would like to share our work/code with others than we can use remote 
    repository to update our work in github. Another advantage will be that we 
    will have a copy of aur repository and even if we lose it locally we can fetch 
    it any time from GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It is because the changes made on github might be the changes made by some 
    other contributor or by yourself and the only time you would like to pull is
    when you want to make changes on the updated version of your github code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used when we want to copy a repository into our Github account 
    from anothers githup account.
    Clones are used when we want to copy entire repository from Github account 
    or from our local repository to our local repository.
    Branches are used when we want to create another branch from our current 
    branch in an experimental case. It can be created both in local as well as
    github.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
